            Hi! I'm Jonathan Cai.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm an undergraduate student at Rice University in Houston, Texas. 
            I'm about to enter my third year, pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science, expecting to graduate May of 2021.
          </p>
          <p>
            Think of this as a brief summary of my work/interests/projects, something like an overly verbose resume, in the off-chance that you are interested in such a thing...
          </p>
          <b>Interests</b>
          <p>
            I've always enjoyed problem-solving and leaving a positive impact (however small) on those around me.
            My professional interests revolve around problems I see in our society 
            - generally, including education, mass media, partisanship, and freedom of speech, and more recently, the financial world.
            {/* but more generally, I'm interested in any opportunity that allows me to use my problem-solving, analytical, and communication skills to leave a positive impact. */}
          </p>
          <p>
            I originally entered Rice as a Political Science major, intending to pursue law school, 
            and having never written a line of code before. 
            But after a few intro CS courses, I saw not just how fun, but how uniquely impactful software can be 
            â€“ engineers (of any age, race, gender, creed) can tackle problems in such a direct way. 
            I've also come to realize how much I love building things I can call my own.
            So as of now (as nothing is ever set in stone), I'm pursuing in a career in the tech industry as a software engineer, and simply
            exploring what we can teach technology, and what technology can teach us.
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside of school and work, I like to play/watch/coach basketball, learn more about personal fitness, 
            discovering new music, and recently, I've been trying to get into personal finance.
          </p>
          <b>Work</b>
          <p>
            I will TA for Rice's COMP 330 course (Tools & Models for Data Science) this upcoming Fall 2019 semester. 
            The work will involve hosting weekly office hours to reinforce lecture material, involving implementation of standard supervised/unsupervised models, 
            using SQL, MapReduce, Apache Spark, Tensorflow.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am a Software Engineering Intern at JP Morgan Chase & Co. in Houston, Texas this Summer 2019 (June - August 2019). 
          </p>
          <p>
            I've previously worked at a small IT company in Cupertino, <a href="https://www.sihuatech.com/" target="_blank">Sihua Technologies</a>, as
            a Software Engineering Intern (June - August 2018). 
            Their <a href="http://miaoyun.io/" target="_blank">Miaoyun</a> team is building a platform for container orchestration.
            I primarily focused on DevOps, using a <a href="https://www.weave.works/blog/gitops-operations-by-pull-request" target="_blank">GitOps</a> workflow to
            improve their CI pipeline, achieving a 70% decrease in average deployment time.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've also volunteered at a local library with <a href="https://coderdojo.com/" target="_blank">CoderDojo</a> to teach some talented young kids some programming.
          </p>
          <p>
            The rest of my experiences are varied - from <a href="https://khanna.house.gov/" target="_blank">a congressional campaign</a>, 
            to <a href="https://www.sacattorneys.com/" target="_blank">my dad's law firm</a>, 
            to <a href="http://www.ufrate.com/en/" target="_blank">a small startup incubator</a>.
