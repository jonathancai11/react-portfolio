            Hi! I'm Jonathan Cai.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm an undergraduate student at Rice University in Houston, Texas. 
            I'm currently in my second year, pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science.
          </p>
          <b>Interests</b>
          <p>
            I've always enjoyed problem-solving and leaving a positive impact (however small) on those around me.
            My professional interests revolve around problems I see in our society 
            - areas include education, mass media, partisanship, and freedom of speech.
            {/* but more generally, I'm interested in any opportunity that allows me to use my problem-solving, analytical, and communication skills to leave a positive impact. */}
          </p>
          <p>
            I originally entered Rice as a Political Science major, intending to pursue law school, 
            and having never written a line of code before. 
            But after a few intro CS courses, I saw not just how fun, but how uniquely impactful software can be 
            â€“ engineers (of any age) can tackle problems in such an immediate way. 
            I also came to realize how much I love building things I can call my own.
            So as of now, I'm interested in a career in the tech industry as a software engineer. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside of school and work, I like to play/watch/coach basketball, learn more about personal fitness, 
            discovering new music, and challenging myself to pick up new things like cooking.
          </p>
          <b>Work</b>
          <p>
            I am an incoming Software Engineering Intern at JP Morgan Chase & Co. in Houston, Texas this Summer 2019 (June - August 2019).
          </p>
          <p>
            I've previously worked at a small company in Cupertino, <a href="https://www.sihuatech.com/" target="_blank">Sihua Technologies</a>, as
            a Software Engineering Intern (June - August 2018). 
            Their <a href="http://miaoyun.io/" target="_blank">Miaoyun</a> team is building a platform for container orchestration.
            I primarily focused on DevOps, using a <a href="https://www.weave.works/blog/gitops-operations-by-pull-request" target="_blank">GitOps</a> workflow to
            improve their CI pipeline.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've also volunteered at a local library with <a href="https://coderdojo.com/" target="_blank">CoderDojo</a> to help teach young kids some programming.
          </p>
          <p>
            The rest of my experiences are varied - from <a href="https://khanna.house.gov/" target="_blank">a congressional campaign</a>, 
            to <a href="https://www.sacattorneys.com/" target="_blank">my dad's law firm</a>, 
            to <a href="http://www.ufrate.com/en/" target="_blank">a small startup incubator</a>.
            You can find out more about these other experiences on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathan-cai/" target="_blank">my LinkedIn</a>.
