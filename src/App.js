                      Hi! I'm Jonathan Cai.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      I'm an undergraduate student at Rice University in Houston, Texas. 
                      I'm about to enter my third year, pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science, expecting to graduate May of 2021.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      This as a brief summary of my work/interests/projects, in the off-chance that you are interested in such a thing...
                    </p>

          </div>



          <b className="header">Interests</b>
          <p>
            I've always enjoyed problem-solving and leaving a positive impact (however small) on those around me.
            My professional interests revolve around problems I see in our society 
            - generally, including education, mass media, partisanship, and freedom of speech, and more recently, the financial world.
          </p>
          <p>
            I originally entered Rice as a Political Science major, intending to pursue law school, 
            and having never written a line of code before. 
            But after a few intro CS courses, I saw not just how fun, but how uniquely impactful software can be 
            â€“ engineers (of any age, race, gender, creed) can tackle problems in such a direct way. 
            I've also come to realize how much I love building things I can call my own.
            So as of now (as nothing is ever set in stone), I'm pursuing in a career in the tech industry as a software engineer, and simply
            exploring what we can teach technology, and what technology can teach us.
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside of school and work, I like to play/watch/coach basketball, learn more about personal fitness, 
            discovering new music, and recently, I've been trying to get into personal finance.
          </p>
          <b className="header">Work</b>

          <p>
            The rest of my experiences are varied - from <a href="https://khanna.house.gov/" target="_blank">a congressional campaign</a>, 
            to <a href="https://www.sacattorneys.com/" target="_blank">my dad's law firm</a>, 
            to <a href="http://www.ufrate.com/en/" target="_blank">a small startup incubator</a>.
            You can find out more about these other experiences on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathan-cai/" target="_blank">my LinkedIn</a>.
