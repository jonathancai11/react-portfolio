## My Profile Website

This repository contains all the source code for my simple personal website at [jonathancai.me](https://jonathancai.me/).<br>
This was bootstrapped with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).<br>
I linked Github Pages with my personal Namecheap domain ([a simple tutorial](https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/9645/2208/how-do-i-link-my-domain-to-github-pages)).
