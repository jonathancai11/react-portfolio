## My Profile Website

This repository contains all the source code for my simple personal website at [jonathancai.me](https://jonathancai.me/).<br>
This was bootstrapped with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).<br>
I linked Github Pages with my personal Namecheap domain ([a simple tutorial](https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/9645/2208/how-do-i-link-my-domain-to-github-pages)).


### How to deploy:
On master branch, make changes and push commits.

 In bash, run "yarn/npm deploy".

 Github will for some reason remove the custom domain, so go to the Github repo, switch to gh-pages branch and add the custom domain (jonathancai.me) to the option on the pages settings.
