### How to deploy:
On master branch, make changes and push commits.

In bash, run "yarn/npm deploy" (while on master branch).

Github will for some reason remove the custom domain, so go to the Github repo, switch to gh-pages branch and add the custom domain (jonathancai.me) to the option on the pages settings.
